Exercise 10: calculateGrade()

Define a function called calculateGrade. 
It should take a numerical score and return the corresponding letter 
grade (A, B, C, D, F). 

For example, 90 and above yields an 'A', 80-89 is a 'B', 
and 70-79 is a 'C', 60-69 is a 'D' and anything lower than a 60 is an 'F'.

Example: calculateGrade(100) should return A.
